# `simd`

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rust-lang-nursery/simd.png)](https://travis-ci.org/rust-lang-nursery/simd)

`simd` offers a basic interface to the SIMD functionality of CPUs.

This crate is expected to become _obsolete_ once the implementation of [RFC 2366](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2366) lands in the standard library.
